<h1>Review</h1>
<h2>National Capital <em>Brookvale</em> &ndash; 11&nbsp;September 2011</h2>

<p>The National Capital <em>Brookvale</em> ride was held on the weekend of 11&ndash;12 September over a 2 x 40&nbsp;km course through the Brindabella Ranges and ACT Uriarra Forest. We had an excellent turnout, with 60&nbsp;riders in the 80&nbsp;km main ride, 21&nbsp;riders in the 40&nbsp;km trainer and 19&nbsp;riders in the 20&nbsp;km social ride. We've received really positive feedback from riders about the course, marking and organisation for this year's event.</p>

<p>The <acronym title="A C T Endurance Riders Association">ACTERA</acronym> ride committee would like to congratulate all those who were successful in the romp around our little hills, and who got to view the hidden daffodil field in the forest. Our commiserations, too, to the gratifyingly small number who were unsuccessful (we had four withdrawn, four lame and one heart rate in the 80&nbsp;km ride and two withdrawn but no vet outs in the 40 and 20&nbsp;kms).</p>

<p>Here's the ride results for the 80&nbsp;km main ride:</p>
