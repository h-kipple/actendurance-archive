<h1>Review</h1>
<h2>National Capital <em>Brookvale</em>, 6&nbsp;September 2009</h2>

<p>The National Capital Endurance Ride returned this year to its old base at <em>Brookvale</em>, a sheep and cattle property in the foothills of the Brindabella Range. The weather was perfect for riding, with thick frost on Sunday morning followed by a calm sunny day. Rain in the previous weeks had softened the tracks and filled the creeks, so water was plentiful on track and at the ride base.</p>

<p>The course was well-marked fire trails through undulating to hilly terrain with some challenging climbs, and a short section along the road verge. The second leg included hills that had been burned out in the January 2003 bushfires and which are only now starting to recover, and offered some stunning views of the surrounding country as far as Canberra.</p>

<p>There were 100 entries altogether, with 42 entries in the main 80&nbsp;km ride, 35 entries in the 40&nbsp;km training ride, and 23 entries in the 20&nbsp;km social ride. Riders took note of the pre-ride advice and the vet-out rate was very low, with 93 completing their rides. Some used the course as a final preparation for the Quilty, while many from the Canberra region entered the shorter rides as an entry or return to the sport of endurance riding, and all seemed to have fun.  The beautiful bush campsite was a highlight of the ride for many.</p>

<p>The Bruce Neal Trophy was won by Maddison Wade on the 16&nbsp;year-old part-Arab,<em>Trigger</em>. The Bruce Neal trophy is a perpetual trophy awarded each year to a junior rider at the National Capital Brookvale ride on the basis of horsemanship demonstrated during the ride.</p>

<p>Fia and Talea Hasko-Stewart won a free entry to the National Capital Horse Show endurance horse class for having equal first local registered Arabian horses across the line, donated by Arabs Inc. Victorian rider Tracy John on <em>Aloha Red Domino</em> won the prize donated by Kerranna Stockhorses for the best performed stockhorse. Many other riders were pleased and surprised to win lucky draw prizes.</p>

<p>Many thanks to all the helpers, especially the ever-cheerful Belinda Hopley, Chief Steward, and the Head Veterinarian, Steve Roberts. WICEN volunteers did the on-course communications and a local scout troop provided hot dinner and breakfast &ndash; not an easy task at a ride camp in the bush.</p>

<p>Many thanks also to our very generous sponsors: Arabs Inc, Bellchambers Produce, Bendora Arabians, Brindabella Stockfeed, Canberra Equine Hospital, The Chaffman/Tankman, Harden Chaff, Horseland Canberra, Kerrana Stockhorses, and the Kelly family.</p>

<p>Last, but most importantly, very special thanks must go to the local landowners whose properties form part of the ride course, and particularly to the Blundell family for continuing to host the ride on their property.</p>
