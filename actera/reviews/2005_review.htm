<h1>National Capital <em>Brookvale</em><br><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">2005 Ride Review</span></h1>

<p>The reduced number of entries at many NSW rides was evident at the annual ride held on the foothills of the Brindabella Ranges on October 30, 2005.</p>

<p>Only 37 riders travelled to the picturesque ride base on the <em>Brookvale</em> property owned by the Blundell family. Those who stayed away may have had a premonition about the weather, with steady and at times hard rain falling almost constantly from late Saturday until Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>The slippery conditions meant that the winning times were much slower than usual. First across the line, 1st Middleweight and Best Conditioned MWT/HWT was Duncan Satchell on <em>Alhambra Mirage</em> in 5:52, followed by 1st Heavyweight Gavin Bartlett on <em>Palmview Silver Elle</em> in 5:56. Second Middleweight Mark Harvey on <em>Judstan Sharwayn</em> was a minute behind.</p>

<p>First Lightweight was Amily Daw on <em>Castlebar Delaware</em> in 7:24. Only two juniors started and both withdrew, due to problems in the wet with their hoofboots.</p>

<p>The rain did make it easier for other barefoot horses. A Barefoot Horse Award sponsored by Blake’s Heaven Barefoot Horses was won by Duncan McLaughlin on <em>Marzipan</em> who completed the 80kms in 8:27.</p>

<p>Of the 20 starters in the main ride, 15 completed successfully, as did 14 of the 17 training ride entrants.</p>

<p><a href="2005_results.htm">See full results on this site</a>.</p>

<p>The ACT Endurance Riders Association extends its thanks to the landowners who again allowed the first leg of the ride to pass through their properties, and to the kind sponsors:</p>

		<li>Bellchambers Produce</li>
		<li>Bendora Boarding Kennels, Catflats &amp; Stables</li>
		<li>Canberra Motor Works</li>
		<li>Canberra Rural Stock Feeds</li>

		<li>Saddleworld Canberra.</li>
	</ul>
<p>Like many other endurance clubs, ACTERA has faced difficulties due to its smaller fields and increasing costs, as well as course problems caused by the 2003 Canberra bushfires.</p>
<p>It will, however, proceed with plans for a 2006 <em>Brookvale</em> ride and has also scheduled <a href="2006_bc_preview.htm">a ride in February 2006 at Equestrian Park</a>, a very hospitable venue within Canberra’s suburbs. We hope this ride will be well supported by riders from near and far.</p>
