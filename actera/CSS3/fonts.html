<h1>Embedded font styles</h1>

<p>The font in the heading above is supposed to be Proclamate Light from Font Squirrel.</p>

<p>The &lt;p&gt; font is supposed to be Angelina Regular.</p>

<p>8 December: Thanks to Jules's feedback, I now know what I did wrong. Have removed the 'class' from H1 and p, and have uploaded the fonts. I didn't notice this at the time - too many distractions at home, I guess. Thanks, Jules.</p>

<p>The fonts are now working in Firefox 14 &ndash; yaay! But not in IE9.</p>

<p><p>The characters for left and right angle brackets (around the 'p' in 2nd para above) are not rendering in Firefox (I thought this was because they are not part of the Angelina character map) but they show up in IE.</p></p>
