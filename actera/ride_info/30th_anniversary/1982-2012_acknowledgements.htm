<h1>30th anniversary 2012: How things have changed 1982&ndash;2012</h1>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>I want first to acknowledge those people who have been involved in the ride over the years but are no longer with us. They include property owners Allen Blundell, John Schunke and Peter Buckmaster; local riders and ACTERA members Bruce Neal, Denis Jeffery, Dennis Dyason, Bob Perriman and Sheree Edlington; and long-time helper Athel Beckwith, who was a time-keeper at several rides. Two winners of the ride, Steve Locke (1999 and 2004) and Ray Fulton (2002), have also passed away as has Graham Williams, who took part in several of the early <em>Brookvale</em> rides and officiated as Chief Steward in 2004.</p>

<p>Allen Blundell, owner of the <em>Brookvale</em> property and an enthusiastic supporter of the ride since 1982, passed away in 2008 but the ride continues to be run from <em>Brookvale</em> with the support of Allen's family, particularly his wife Judy and son Brian. He is commemorated by the <a href="../trophies.htm#blundelltrophy">Allen Blundell Memorial Trophy</a>, a perpetual trophy for horsemanship that was awarded for the first time in 2011. Bruce Neal has been commemorated since 2000 by the <a href="../trophies.htm#nealtrophy">Bruce Neal Perpetual Trophy</a>, which is an encouragement award for junior riders.</p>
