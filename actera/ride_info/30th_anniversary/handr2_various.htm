<a name="perriman"></a><h3>Bob Perriman and <em>Persius</em></h3>

<span style="float:left; padding:0.5em; margin:0.5em;"><a href="../../photos/30th_anniversary/handr2_Image9.JPG"><img src="../../photos/30th_anniversary/tn_handr2_Image9.jpg" width="71" height="100" alt="Bob Perriman at Brookvale" title="Bob Perriman at Brookvale" border="0" /></a></span>

<p>Bob started endurance riding in 1982, around the time he retired, and competed in several rides during the 1980s. He and his six-year-old chestnut part-Arabian gelding <em>Persius</em> (&lsquo;Percy&rsquo;) entered the first <em>Brookvale</em> ride but were not successful. They completed the ride in 1983 and again in 1986, being placed second heavyweight on both occasions. Bob was involved in organising the early <em>Brookvale</em> rides and later served as ACTERA president.</p> 

<br><br><br><br>
<a name="georgeff"></a><h3>Dianne Georgeff and <em>Jedda</em></h3>

<p>Dianne Georgeff (Keddie) and her chestnut thoroughbred mare <em>Jedda</em> were another successful local combination in the 1980s. They completed two Quilties and a Shahzada plus several rides of 80&ndash;120&nbsp;km, including the 110&nbsp;km <em>Brookvale</em> ride twice.</p>

<a name="mcginn"></a><h3>John McGinn and <em>Pinocchio</em></h3>

<p>John McGinn, a successful heavyweight rider in the 1980s, had several horses, but the one probably best remembered is his part-Arabian gelding <em>Pinocchio</em>, who had been a bucking horse in rodeos before John bought him. Despite his ongoing tendency to buck, he turned out to be a good endurance horse and had accumulated 1000&nbsp;miles (1600&nbsp;km) before being killed by a train in 1988.</p>

<a name="wallace"></a><h3>Debbie and John Wallace and <em>Glenallan Solitary Man</em> (&lsquo;Solly&rsquo;)</h3>

<span style="float:left; padding:0.5em; margin:0.5em;"><a href="../../photos/30th_anniversary/handr2_Image6.jpg"><img src="../../photos/30th_anniversary/tn_handr2_Image6.jpg" width="100" height="150" alt="Debbie and Solly (photo taken at an Adaminaby ride)" title="Debbie and Solly (photo taken at an Adaminaby ride)" border="0" /></a></span>

<p>Debbie and <em>Solly</em> were the first local rider and first local horse to win the National Capital (<em>Brookvale</em>) ride, which they did in 1985 when Solly was 10&nbsp;years old. He missed the first <em>Brookvale</em> ride because, after organising the Burra training ride in September 1982 and having helped to organise the <em>Brookvale</em> ride, John and Debbie moved to Queensland for a couple of years, returning in 1985.</p>
 
<p><em>Solly</em>, a part-Arab gelding, did his first endurance ride at Kangaroo Valley in 1981. In an endurance career spanning 10&nbsp;years, he completed many rides in both NSW and Queensland, the highlights of which included winning the 200&nbsp;km Warwick to Nerang ride in 1983 and finishing the 160&nbsp;km Colo Challenge in 1987 and the Quilty in 1990. He lived to the age of 30 before succumbing to cancer in 2005, having been with Debbie for 25&nbsp; years.</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<a name="monchaux"></a><h3>Marie de Monchaux and <em>Tilden Zeichen</em></h3>

<span style="float:left; padding:0.5em; margin:0.5em;"><a href="../../photos/30th_anniversary/handr2_Image7.jpg"><img src="../../photos/30th_anniversary/tn_handr2_Image7.jpg" width="120" height="117" alt="Cymreig Rustler&rsquo;s tile portrait" title="Cymreig Rustler&rsquo;s tile portrait" border="0" /></a></span>

<p>Marie first attempted the <em>Brookvale</em> ride in 1982 on a five-year-old Australian Stock Horse gelding named <em>Cedar</em> but withdrew at the end of the second leg when she realised she was unlikely to complete the ride in the time allowed. She had a Welsh pony stud near Canberra and in 1984 tried the <em>Brookvale</em> ride again on her 13.1Â½&nbsp;hh Welsh B stallion <em>Cymreig Rustler</em>. Marie, a tall woman, remembers her feet having been quite close to the ground during that ride!</p>

<span style="float:right; padding:0.5em; margin:0.5em;"><a href="../../photos/30th_anniversary/handr2_Image8.JPG"><img src="../../photos/30th_anniversary/tn_handr2_Image8.jpg" width="107" height="150" alt="Marie on Tilden Zeichen with Chris Robertson on Prancer, Brookvale 1985" title="Marie on Tilden Zeichen with Chris Robertson on Prancer, Brookvale 1985" border="0" /></a></span>
<span style="float:left; padding:0.5em; margin:0.5em;"></span>

<p><em>Rustler&rsquo;s</em> successful completion of the challenging 110&nbsp;km ride, carrying 80&nbsp;kg, was a remarkable performance. He completed the 110&nbsp;km course in 12&nbsp;hours 15&nbsp;minutes, placing 9th Open, and won a tile portrait of himself by Brigitte Heyer for being the smallest horse to finish.</p>

<p>Marie completed the ride again in 1985 and 1986 on her Welsh B gelding <em>Tilden Zeichen</em> (&lsquo;Zeke&rsquo;), by <em>Cymreig Rustler</em> from a thoroughbred mare. A few years later Marie bought the purebred Arabian gelding <em>Kelkette Park Ibn Khazelle</em>, on which she completed the <em>Brookvale</em> ride four more times, as well as several other rides. He was bought by another local rider, the late Denis Jeffrey, when Marie moved to North Queensland in 1997.</p>
