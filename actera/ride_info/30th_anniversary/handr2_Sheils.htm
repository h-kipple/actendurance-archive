<h3>Paul Sheils and <em>Visty</em></h3>

<span style="float:left; padding:0.5em; margin:0.5em;"><a href="../../photos/30th_anniversary/handr2_Image15.jpg"><img src="../../photos/30th_anniversary/tn_handr2_Image15.jpg" width="86" height="120" alt="Paul Sheils on Visty, Kangaroo Valley 1990" title="Paul Sheils on Visty, Kangaroo Valley 1990" border="0" /></a></span>

<p>When Paul met Melanie, his main recreational interests were bushwalking and cross-country skiing but he quickly became interested in horses. His old climbing rope, that he had carried on many walks in the rugged mountainous country of south-eastern Queensland for abseiling down rock faces, became the fence for Melanie's temporary horse yard, attached to four star pickets.</p>  

<p>After strapping for Melanie at her first few rides, Paul took up endurance riding himself. His horse was a part-Arab gelding named <em>El Visto Marengo</em> but known as &lsquo;Visty&rsquo;. <em>Visty</em> was a willing and good-natured horse but difficult to manage in an endurance ride because if let go at his own speed he would often become lame because of his big, pounding trot. But if held back, he would become stressed and often vet out on heart rate. Despite several vet outs, he and Paul completed enough rides together for <em>Visty</em> to be awarded his 1600&nbsp;km scroll.</p> 

<p>Their first endurance ride was at <em>Brookvale</em> in 1987, in which they finished second in the heavyweight division. One of Paul's favourite memories of his rides is <em>Visty</em> whizzing through the trees on the bridle path along Swamp Creek near the end of that ride. Others include <em>Visty</em> helping Paul up the big hills on the Adaminaby rides from Yaouk when Paul was affected by asthma, and <em>Visty</em> powering along the side of the Brindabella Road with thunder crashing overhead and their way illuminated by flashes of lightning as they headed towards the Brindabella checkpoint in the 1991 Canberra to Tumut ride.</p> 

<p><em>Visty's</em> last endurance ride was at Wagga in 1994 but he was ridden lightly for many more years and had reached his late&nbsp;20s when he had to be put down due to a twisted bowel. He and <em>Piedy</em> are both buried at the back of the property on the outskirts of Canberra where they had lived for many years.</p>
