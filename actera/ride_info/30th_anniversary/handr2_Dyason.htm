<h2>Some local horses and riders of the 1970s and 1980s (Part 2)</h2>

<h2>The Dyason family</h2>

<span style="float:left; padding:0.5em; margin:0.5em;"><a href="../../photos/30th_anniversary/handr2_Image3.jpg"><img src="../../photos/30th_anniversary/tn_handr2_Image3.jpg" width="150" height="107" alt="Kath Dyason just after receiving her first buckle, Batlow 1984" title="Kath Dyason just after receiving her first buckle, Batlow 1984" border="0" /></a></span>

<p>Kathryn (Kath) Dyason entered the first <em>Brookvale</em> ride on an 11-year-old stock horse mare named <em>My Pixie</em>. <em>Pixie</em> coped well with the hot, dry conditions, her heart rate remaining in the 40s, but as they had taken nearly 11&nbsp;hours to cover the first two legs, Kath decided to withdraw at that point rather than try to complete the ride in the remaining time. Her daughter Megan, nearly three-quarters of an hour ahead, continued and finished as first junior with a time of 11&nbsp;hours 55&nbsp;minutes. Megan was also riding a stock horse, an 8-year-old gelding named <em>Euree Mandingo</em> (&lsquo;Mannie&rsquo;). <em>Mannie</em> was quite small but very capable, being good at everything Megan asked of him. With a naturally low heart rate that dropped quickly, he would have made a good endurance horse, but Megan's main interest was eventing.</p>

<p>Kath's first successful completion was at Batlow in 1984, where she rode <em>Mannie</em>.</p>
<br>


<p>Kath and her husband Dennis decided to continue endurance riding and changed to Arabian horses. Dennis bought a part-Arab gelding, <em>Myluka Marrak</em>. Kath bought a part Arab called <em>Lobo</em>, by the same sire as the great endurance horse <em>Glenallan Solomon</em> (&lsquo;Salty&rsquo;). Kath rode <em>Lobo</em> for four years, during which he completed a Quilty, a Shahzada and a NSW State Championship ride as well as numerous shorter rides including the <em>Brookvale</em> ride three times (1984, 1985 and 1986). Their big year was 1986 when they came second in the NSW One Horse One Rider category with 1,146&nbsp;km.</p>

<span style="float:left; padding:0.5em; margin:0.5em;"><a href="../../photos/30th_anniversary/handr2_Image5_opt.jpg"><img src="../../photos/30th_anniversary/tn_handr2_Image5_opt.jpg" width="107" height="150" alt="Dennis Dyason on Marrak, Brookvale 1995 (photo by Brigitte Heyer)" title="Dennis Dyason on Marrak, Brookvale 1995 (photo by Brigitte Heyer)" border="0" /></a></span>

<p>Local riders filled the four top placings in that category that year, with Rowena Hadlow and <em>Deakin Blue</em> first with 1,376&nbsp;km, Marie Hill (de Monchaux) and <em>Tilden Zeichen</em> third with 1,125&nbsp;km and Dianne Georgeff and <em>Jedda</em> fourth with 771&nbsp;km. Searle Johnston and <em>Shinda</em> were equal fifth with 750&nbsp;km. <em>Lobo</em> was also placed third in the NSW Distance Horse pointscore and Kath fourth in NSW Distance Rider. The same riders also did well nationally in 1986, with Rowena, Searle, Kath and Marie being among the Top&nbsp;10 Distance Riders; <em>Deakin Blue</em>, <em>Binda</em>, <em>Lobo</em> and <em>Tilden Zeichen</em> among the Top&nbsp;10 Distance Horses; <em>Deakin Blue</em> and <em>Jedda</em> in the Top&nbsp;10 National Horses and with Rowena and Di in the Top&nbsp;10 teams of One Horse One Rider.</p>
<br> 

<p>Kath was probably the first endurance rider from the Canberra district to compete internationally, placing equal 15th in the European Championships in France in 1991 on a borrowed mare named <em>Lola</em>. She continued riding until 1993, mainly on <em>Lobo</em> and two mares, <em>Kea</em> and <em>Glenallan Palerider</em> (&lsquo;Flapper&rsquo;). Dennis's endurance career was interrupted by a badly broken leg as the result of a fall from <em>Marrak</em> but they completed several rides before and after that, including the Cobb & Co 200 in 1989. Kath and Dennis also sometimes lent their horses to other people to ride.</p>
