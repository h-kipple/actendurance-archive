<h1>30th anniversary 2012: How things have changed 1982&ndash;2012</h1>

<h2>Training and social rides</h2>  

<p>For many years a training ride and an introductory (social) ride have been held in conjunction with the National Capital endurance ride, but that was not always the case. In the early 1980s an encouragement ride of between 40 and 50&nbsp;km was run in mid-September, about two months before the main ride. These encouragement rides were from 40 to 50&nbsp;km in length, in two legs with a vet check and a full one hour stop between them. One or two lead riders &ndash; experienced endurance riders whose role was to restrict the pace &ndash; set out about 15&nbsp;minutes before the ride started. Riders were divided into senior and junior categories and sometimes into weight divisions as for an endurance ride. As well as completion awards for all successful competitors, there was a trophy or prize for the fittest horse in the senior and junior divisions. The encouragement rides were not affiliated with NSWERA so were not bound by the rules and could be run differently from affiliated training rides. In 1984 ACTERA held a training and encouragement ride concurrently and in 1986 decided that future encouragement rides that it held would be affiliated. From then on they were known as training rides and were run under NSWERA rules.</p> 

<p>The early encouragement rides were originally held at Burra and then at the Southwell family's property near Bredbo. They were held at <em>Brookvale</em> from 1985 but it was not until 1989 that a training ride was held concurrently with the main ride. For a few years ACTERA continued to run one or more additional short rides during the year. For example, in 1990 there were 25&nbsp;km and 40&nbsp;km rides in August in Stromlo Forest, from a base at Blue Gums Picnic Area, and a 50&nbsp;km ride near Michelago in October, as well as the endurance ride and training ride at <em>Brookvale</em> in November.  The Michelago ride was based at the Ryrie family's <em>Micalago Station</em> and comprised a 50&nbsp;km loop into the Tinderry Range, with a vet check part of the way around the course. In 1992 the Michelago training ride was run in July and a special 50&nbsp;km training ride from Equestrian Park to the Rose Cottage horse paddocks and back was held in October to showcase Canberra from its equestrian trails. From 1998 a social ride, originally 30&nbsp;km but now 20&nbsp;km, has usually been held with the main ride.</p> 

<p>For about 10&nbsp;years from the mid-1990s the newly-established Capital Territory Division Endurance Riders Association (CTDERA) held endurance carnivals in or near Canberra, at either Equestrian Park or Kowen Forest. They included rides ranging from major endurance events to training rides and very short introductory rides which met the needs of local riders wishing to enter the sport. When CTDERA became inactive, ACTERA began holding the Bush Capital endurance event in Canberra in February each year, comprising training and introductory rides and sometimes an endurance ride.</p>
