<h1>30th anniversary 2012: How things have changed 1982&ndash;2012</h1>

<h2>Some things haven't changed</h2>

<p>Although much has changed, the essential character of the <em>Brookvale</em> ride remains much the same. The ride still provides a course through some spectacular bush scenery, some of which is within sight of the national capital. The ride base, only about three-quarters of an hour's drive from Parliament House, is still a bush campsite where, when people have gone to bed and the only sounds from the camp are the movements of the horses, you can hear the tinkling of the creek, the croaking of the frogs and the sounds of the cattle nearby. While much easier than 30&nbsp;years ago, the ride is still challenging enough to give riders a sense of achievement when they complete it.</p> 

<p>The people change, of course, as some people stop riding and others take up the sport, but many come back year after year and camp in their favourite spots on the hill or by the creek. Some have been riding at <em>Brookvale</em> since they were children. We also now have a second generation of <em>Brookvale</em> riders, with the children of some of the early riders now competing as adults. Someone who has been to nearly every <em>Brookvale</em> ride from 1982 onward is Searle Johnston, one of the founders of the ride and holder of 11 National Capital Endurance Ride buckles, as well as being actively involved in running the event for many years. Searle, now aged 81, is still a regular participant in the <em>Brookvale</em> rides and intends to take part again this year though, as in the last few years, in one of the shorter rides rather than the full 80&nbsp;km.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;">We hope to see many of the people who have been involved in some way with the ride over the last 30&nbsp; years, as well as others there for the first time, at <em>Brookvale</em> on 27&ndash;28 October 2012</p>
