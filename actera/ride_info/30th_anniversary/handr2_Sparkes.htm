<h3>Carol Sparkes and <em>Zamfir</em></h3>

<span style="float:left; padding:0.5em; margin:0.5em;"><a href="../../photos/30th_anniversary/handr2_Image10_opt.jpg"><img src="../../photos/30th_anniversary/tn_handr2_Image10_opt.jpg" width="90" height="120" alt="Carol Sparkes and Zamfir, Brookvale 1989" title="Carol Sparkes and Zamfir, Brookvale 1989" border="0" /></a></span>

<p>Carol and <em>Zamfir</em>, a bay purebred Arabian gelding, did their first endurance ride in 1984 when <em>Zamfir</em> was five. When Carol bought him, she was unsure what she wanted to do with him but became interested in endurance after attending a seminar/video night organised by ACTERA at Canberra Riding Club. One of his first attempts was the 1984 National Capital Ride, which he and Carol completed successfully. They did so again in 1985, finishing first lightweight. That was one of their many successes in 1985, in which Carol was NSW Lightweight Rider of the Year. She then switched to the open (middleweight) division and continued to do well. Carol and <em>Zamfir</em> finished third pen in the <em>Brookvale</em> ride in 1988 and won the ride in 1989.</p>

<p><em>Zamfir's</em> career highlights included completion of two Quilties, a NSW and a Queensland state championship and a Shahzada.</p>

<p>Carol sold him in the early 1990s to the Haigh family, who rode him with some success but sold him on. Carol was living in Queensland in 1997 and heard <em>Zamfir</em> was retired. She was able to get him back and started riding him again. In 2001, with <em>Zamfir</em> 22&nbsp;years old, Carol started competing again with an 80&nbsp;km ride and then a Queensland State Championship ride, both successfully completed.  Next year at 23, he completed three 80&nbsp;km rides, placing fourth, seventh and first. He also placed 18th at an FEI ride but vetted out on the third leg that year at the Tom Quilty.</p>

<p>When Carol moved to the United States because of her husband's work, <em>Zam</em> went to work for the McIntyre Centre Riding For the Disabled until 2009 when, three days after his 30th birthday, he was put to sleep after a bad bout of colic.</p>

<p><em>Zamfir</em> was gelded quite late and had already sired a partbred foal, which Carol named <em>Sonazam</em>. Carol completed the National Capital ride on him in 1991. He now lives in Queensland and at the age of 29 is the darling of the West Brisbane Pony Club set, winning many ribbons and hearts along the way!</p>
