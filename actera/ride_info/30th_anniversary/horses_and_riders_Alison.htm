<p>The first riders from this district to attempt the Quilty were Alison Parker (now Alison Hudson) from
Bungendore and her friend Suzie Horne. In 1971, only five years after the first Quilty, endurance riding was still a new sport in Australia. There was little information available for people wanting to try the sport, and few rides in which to gain experience. At that time, there were no qualification requirements for the Quilty and for many horses and riders, it was their first endurance ride. Ally and Suzie, who were neighbours near Bungendore, wanted to try something different and decided to enter the 1971 Quilty &ndash; Ally on her young palomino stallion <em>Sundance</em> (later registered as <em>Majura Gold</em>) and Suzie on <em>Sundance&rsquo;s</em> half-sister <em>Amber</em>. Ally and Suzie had trained their horses for several weeks in the hills between Bungendore and Lake George and the horses were reasonably fit. <em>Amber</em> completed the ride successfully but <em>Sundance</em> vetted out on pulse at the end of the third leg, having covered 86 of the 100&nbsp;miles. With the experience gained from this ride and a lot of valuable advice from other riders at the Quilty on how to prepare a horse for a ride of this kind, Ally and Suzie returned the following year with the same horses, now fitter and clipped, and this time both were successful in a riding time of just over 16Â½&nbsp;hours. <em>Sundance</em> did no more endurance rides but has at least two local endurance horses among his progeny: Kristen Proudfoot&rsquo;s mare <em>Chicky</em> and Searle Johnston&rsquo;s gelding <em>Brindabella Bold Boris</em>, one of <em>Chicky&rsquo;s</em> foals.</p>

<p>Alison had other interests, including polocrosse, barrel racing and flag racing, and did not continue with endurance after winning her Quilty buckle in 1972. But ten years later, when the first National Capital Endurance Ride was being organised, she decided to enter it. Her Australian Stock Horse mare, <em>Soft Breeze</em>, was already fit from a season of polocrosse and needed only regular riding in the hills around Bungendore, where Ally had trained for the Quilty, to maintain her fitness. Alison (then
Alison Guy), her neighbour Jan Neal and friend Judith Perkins all entered the 50&nbsp;km encouragement ride at Burra on 19 September 1982, organised by the ACT Endurance Riders Association to help local riders prepare for the 110&nbsp;km ride in November. All three successfully completed the encouragement ride, Ally on <em>Soft Breeze</em>, Judith on her part-Arabian gelding <em>Razzle Dazzle</em> (bred by Alison) and Jan Neal on her first-cross quarter horse gelding <em>Bruven Champ</em>. They entered the endurance ride in November with the same horses. Ally and Judith were two of only 16 riders out of 39 starters to finish, with Ally placing 6th open and sharing the First Local Lady Rider award with Judith, who was 4th lightweight.</p>

<p>Alison has had a life-long interest in Arabian horses and for many years she and her husband Ray have
bred Arabians on their Quartz Hill stud near Bungendore.</p>
