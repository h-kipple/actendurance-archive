<p>The ACT Endurance Riders Association would like to invite you to our TPR (temperature, pulse and respiration) and Introduction to Endurance Riding training day on 23 September at Kambah Pony Club, ACT.</p>
 
<h2>What is TPR?</h2>
<p>TPR stewards assist vets at endurance rides by monitoring the temperature, pulse and respiration of horses before, during and after a ride.  Being able to confidently take your own horse's temperature, pulse and respiration will enable you to monitor its health and fitness and be responsive to any potential problem that may arise, whether in the paddock or during competition.</p>
  
<h2>The day's program</h2>
<h3>Morning</h3>
<p>The morning session commences at 9.00&nbsp;am and involves learning the meaning and consequence of the various sounds and rhythms of the heart and respiration.  It also explains their relevance and application to the regulations of endurance riding. There will be a hands-on component where you will take the TPR of a number of horses.</p>

<p>This will be followed by a short test for those who wish to become provisional TPRs. Once you have done the test you are a Provisional TPR until you have TPRâ€™d at three rides and then become an Accredited TPR. To maintain accreditation, you must TPR at one ride per year.  When you have then done 20 rides, NSWERA awards you your own personalized TPR vest and a thermometer, stopwatch and stethoscope.</p>

<h3>Lunch</h3>
<p>Lunch will be around 12&nbsp;midday and will be a sausage sizzle kindly sponsored by NSWERA and the NSW Department of Sport and Recreation. <em>Please register to receive your free sausage sandwich and drink.</em> Notes and the NSWERA hHandbook will also be provided.</p>

<h3>Afternoon</h3>

<p>The afternoon component commences at 1.00&nbsp;pm (finishing around 3.30&nbsp;pm) and will consist of short sessions covering your first ride (what to expect, rules and regulations), gear for the horse (including shoeing) and rider, getting your horse fit (including feeding) and how to strap your horse.  If you only wish to attend the afternoon session, the cost is $5.00 and includes notes.</p>

<p>So, whether you would like to begin endurance or just enjoy a social afternoon learning more about your horse's health and wellbeing, please register your interest in either session.</p>
