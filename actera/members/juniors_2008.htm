<p>ACTERA member Talea Hasko-Stewart completed a big year of endurance by placing First National Junior Endurance Rider in Distance and being narrowly pipped for second in points!</p>

<p>Talea was also first in points and distance in NSW and the two horses she competed on, <em>Blake's Heaven Ventura</em> and <em>Blake's Heaven Summer Reign</em>, were first and second in both points and distance in NSW. They were also high up in the national pointscore and distance pointscore.</p>

<p>Talea rode 1504&nbsp;km in successful endurance competition in 2008 &ndash; more than any other person in NSW. Four hundred of her kilometres came from the Shahzada Memorial Test ride held in St&nbsp;Albans. Talea completed on <em>BH Summer Reign</em> for first junior and fifth overall, with excellent parameters throughout the ride despite a brush with greasy heel at the end. It was Talea's fourth attempt at Shahzada, and her first success, so a very happy outcome.</p>

<p>Talea was also awarded the Steve Locke Memorial Trophy for the last placed junior as no other junior rider completed. Talea knew Steve quite well &ndash; Steve's daughter, Zoe, was a leading junior when Talea started endurance, aged eight, and Talea was often mistaken for blond-haired Zoe. Steve Locke died several years ago.</p>

<p>Given the very tough conditions at Shahzada, the decision was made to put shoes on Reign after his glued-on boots came off during the first 52&nbsp;km leg. The shoes were pulled off after Shahzada and all the other kilometres by Reign and Ventura were completed barefoot, or booted at the front only.</p>

<p>Another ACTERA junior member, Jeremy Banwell, was also in the NSW top 10, achieving seventh place in points and sixth place in distance with 324&nbsp;km.</p>

<p>Adeline Gibson's horse, <em>Blake's Heaven Dubonnet</em>, was ninth in Lightweight Distance Horse.</p>
