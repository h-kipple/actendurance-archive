<h3>Course</h3>
<p>80&nbsp;km ride</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="../photos/NatCap14/Leg1_2014red_re.jpg">Leg 1 (50 km)</a>: dirt road and tracks primarily through Brindabella National Park</li>
		<li><a href="../photos/NatCap14/Leg2_2014_topo_lab_red_re.jpg">Leg 2 (30 km)</a>: ACT Uriarra Forest, Two Sticks Road</li>
	</ul>

<p><a href="../photos/NatCap14/Trainer_2014.jpg">40&nbsp;km trainer</a></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Dirt road and tracks in ACT Uriarra Forest, Blue Range Road, Two Sticks Road</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>20 km Introductory ride</p>
	<ul>
		<li>dirt road and tracks in ACT Uriarra Forest</li>
	</ul>

<p>The 80&nbsp;km course is very challenging with substantial hills to climb in Leg&nbsp;1 and undulating track in Leg&nbsp;2. Training ride is challenging, with a major climb. Introductory ride is undulating. <a href="nat_cap_2014_elevations.pdf">See elevations for all courses</a>.</p>

<p>Footing is variable, ranging from soft to rocky &ndash; see photos of Webbs Ridge: <a href="../photos/NatCap14/WebbsRidge1_.jpg">view 1</a> | <a href="../photos/NatCap14/WebbsRidge2_.jpg">view 2</a> | <a href="../photos/NatCap14/WebbsRidge3_.jpg">view 3</a> | <a href="../photos/NatCap14/WebbsRidge_in_August_.jpg">in August</a>. Booting of barefoot horses recommended, at least for longer distances.</p>

<h3>Ride base</h3>
<p><em>Brookvale</em> is a no-frills campsite in a picturesque valley with a fresh water creek running through it. Basic facilities with hired toilets. Horse water available. Cooking fires permitted as long as there is no major change in fire outlook. Shops/petrol station in Canberra approximately 40&nbsp;minutes away. <strong>Keep your dog at home or tied up in camp at all times or risk disqualification! Bring your own drinking water!</strong></p> 

<h3>Temperature log and horse health declaration</h3>
<p>Due to new council regulations, <strong>all 80&nbsp;km and 40&nbsp;km riders</strong> need to <a href="ACTERA-temperature-log.pdf">fill in a log of their horse's temperature</a> for the three days prior to the ride, and sign the horse health declaration on the entry form.</p>
<p>For (local) 20&nbsp;km riders, it is sufficient to sign the horse health declaration.</p>
<p>Riders who do not have the temperature log and come from or have been with their horse in the Hendra endemic area north of Newcastle in the past three weeks will need to <strong>unload their horse at the ride base entry</strong> for a health check by the vet before entering the ride base.</p>

<h3>Directions to ride base</h3>
<p>The entry to the <em>Brookvale</em> property is located off Mountain Creek Road, approximately 3.8&nbsp;km past the intersection of Uriarra Road, ACT, and Mountain Creek Road, about 30&ndash;40&nbsp;minutes from Canberra. Ride base is located along Doctors Flat Road, approximately 1.5&nbsp;km from the intersection with Mountain Creek Road. Signs will be posted from Uriarra Road onwards.</p>

<h3>Changes to Cotter Road and Uriarra Road alignment &ndash; 2014</h3>

<div style="font-size:large;">
<p>1. Coming off the Tuggeranong Parkway at Cotter Road exit, proceed through the Streeton Drive intersection onto John Gorton Drive and continue for approximately 2.6&nbsp;km. Turn LEFT onto OPPERMAN AVENUE at the traffic lights, heading towards Stromlo Forest Park (photo 1).</p>
<p><a href="../photos/NatCap14/photo1_opperman_avenue.jpg"><img src="../photos/NatCap14/tn_photo1_opperman_avenue.jpg" width="120" height="68" alt="Turn from John Gorton Drive onto Opperman Avenue towards Stromlo Forest Park and Uriarra Road" title="Turn from John Gorton Drive onto Opperman Avenue towards Stromlo Forest Park and Uriarra Road" border="0" /></a><br>Photo 1: Turn at Opperman Avenue, following the sign to Stromlo Forest Park</p>

<p>Go through one roundabout, and at the second roundabout (at Stromlo Forest Park) take the second exit onto the new URIARRA ROAD (photo 2).</p>
<p><a href="../photos/NatCap14/photo2_uriarria_road.jpg"><img src="../photos/NatCap14/tn_photo2_uriarria_road.jpg" width="120" height="68" alt="Take second exit from roundabout onto Uriarra Road" title="Take second exit from roundabout onto Uriarra Road" border="0" /></a><br>Photo 2: Turn right onto new Uriarra Road at the Stromlo Forest Part roundabout</p>

<p>2. Coming via Coppins Crossing along the new John Gorton Drive, turn RIGHT onto OPPERMAN AVENUE at the traffic lights (photo 3) and head towards Stromlo Forest Park as described above.<p>

<p><a href="../photos/NatCap14/photo3_from_coppins_crossing.jpg"><img src="../photos/NatCap14/tn_photo3_from_coppins_crossing.jpg" width="120" height="68" alt="Turn from John Gorton Drive onto Opperman Avenue heading towards Stromlo Forest Park and Uriarra Road" title="Turn from John Gorton Drive onto Opperman Avenue heading towards Stromlo Forest Park and Uriarra Road" border="0" /></a><br>Photo 3: Turn onto Opperman Avenue from John Gorton Drive coming from Coppins Crossing</p>

<p>3. Coming from the direction of Cotter River along Cotter Road, turn left at Swallowtail Road (the old Uriarra Road &ndash; photo 4). This leads to John Gorton Drive. Turn left and proceed along John Gorton Drive to Opperman Avenue, turn left and head towards Stromlo Forest Park as above.</p>

<p><a href="../photos/NatCap14/photo4_from_cotter_river.jpg"><img src="../photos/NatCap14/tn_photo4_from_cotter_river.jpg" width="120" height="68" alt="Swallowtail Road to Stromlo Forest Park and Uriarra Road via John Gorton Drive" title="Swallowtail Road to Stromlo Forest Park and Uriarra Road via John Gorton Drive" border="0" /></a><br>From Cotter Road, the now-Swallowtail Rail, formerly Uriarra Road, leads to John Gorton Drive</p>

<p>Note that is is still possible to turn left onto Cotter Road shortly after the Streeton Drive intersection, as per last year (photo 5). However, doing so will take you to Swallowtail Road (the old Uriarra Road), which ultimately leads to John Gorton Drive as above. It is preferable to follow the directions in step 1 above.</p>

<p><a href="../photos/NatCap14/photo5_alternative.jpg"><img src="../photos/NatCap14/tn_photo5_alternative.jpg" width="120" height="68" alt="Not preferred - using Cotter Road-Swallowtail Road" title="Not preferred - using Cotter Road-Swallowtail Road" border="0" /></a><br>Photo 5: Less-preferred alternative route using Cotter Road as per last year</p>
