<h2>National Capital <em>Brookvale</em>, 18&ndash;19 October 2014</h2>

<p>As is traditional at this time of year, the ACT Endurance Riders Association (ACTERA) would like to invite you to join them for the <em>Brookvale</em> ride near Canberra on the weekend of 18 &amp; 19 October 2014. Rides of 80&nbsp;km, 40&nbsp;km and 20&nbsp;km distance will be held on the Sunday.</p>

<p>Come and enjoy the friendly atmosphere and bush scenery the <em>Brookvale</em> ride offers. Volunteers are welcome! The ride is affiliated with the Snowy Zone and counts towards the zone point scores.</p>

<h3>The course</h3>
<p>The <strong>80&nbsp;km</strong> ride consists of two legs of 50&nbsp;km and 30&nbsp;km distance respectively.</p>

<p>The first leg travels through Brindabella National Park, among other trails utilising the beautiful Webb's Ridge Fire Trail, returning to the ride base via Two Sticks Road.</p>

<p>The second leg winds through the Uriarra Pine Forest, where we found a new loop with the most fantastic views of surrounding areas, and returns to base via private property.</p>

<p>See photos: <a href="../photos/NatCap14/Leg1_2014.jpg">map of 50&nbsp;km first leg</a> | <a href="../photos/NatCap14/Leg2_2014.jpg">map of 30&nbsp;km second leg</a> | <a href="../photos/NatCap14/NewLoop_view1.jpg">view from second leg</a> | <a href="../photos/NatCap14/NewLoop_view2.jpg">another view from second leg</a> | <a href="../photos/NatCap14/NewLoop_view3.jpg">further view from second leg</a></p>

<p>The <strong>40&nbsp;km</strong> course initially follows the second leg of the 80&nbsp;km course, but then veers off to follow Blue Range Road to the top of the range, again providing stunning views towards Canberra and surrounds. <a href="../photos/NatCap14/Trainer_2014.jpg">See map of 40&nbsp;km course</a>.</p>

<p>The <strong>22&nbsp;km</strong> introductory ride is an abbreviated version of the second leg of the 80&nbsp;km ride and follows an undulating course in Uriarra Forest. <a href="../photos/NatCap14/Intro_2014.jpg">See map of 22&nbsp;km introductory ride</a>.</p>

<p>The footing for all rides is a mixture of forest tracks and roads, rocky stretches and dirt road. Both the 80&nbsp;km and 40&nbsp;km rides are true challenging mountain rides and therefore require horses that are fit for the respective ride distance. <a href="../photos/NatCap14/NewLoop_footing at start.jpg">See photo of track footing at start of new loop.</a>.</p>

<h3>Admin and vetting</h3> 
<p>Office and vetting are open <strong>12.00&nbsp;pm&ndash;5.00&nbsp;pm on Saturday</strong>.</p>

<p>We encourage riders in the <strong>40&nbsp;km and 20&nbsp;km rides</strong> to vet on Saturday, but those who don't wish to camp overnight may vet on Sunday from 7.30 am. Please arrive no later than 7.30 am on Sunday morning to allow enough time to enter and vet before your ride.</p>

<h3>Ride base</h3>
<p><em>Brookvale</em> is a no-frills campsite in a picturesque valley with a freshwater creek running through it. Facilities are basic, with bush toilets/portaloos and horse water available. You will need to <strong>bring your own drinking water</strong>.</p>

<p>The possibility of lighting enclosed cooking fires will depend on the development of the fire season.</p>

<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps; font-weight:bold;">Important</span>: <em>Brookvale</em> is a working sheep and cattle property. If you can, please don't bring dogs to the ride, but if you need to, <strong>they must be kept on a lead at all times</strong>.</p>

<h3>Catering</h3>
<p>A canteen will be open from <strong>Saturday lunch until Sunday afternoon</strong>, serving sausage sandwiches, egg &amp; bacon sandwiches, burgers, salad, cakes and muffins, as well as hot and cold drinks.</p>

<p>The closest shops and petrol station are located at the Cooleman Court Shopping Centre in Weston Creek, approximately half an hour from the ride base.</p>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<p>The entry to the <em>Brookvale</em> property is located off Mountain Creek Road, approximately 3.8&nbsp;km past the intersection of Uriarra Road, ACT, and Mountain Creek Road. The ride base is approximately 1.5&nbsp;km along Doctors Flat Road, which commences at the property entry. Signs to the ride base will be put up from Uriarra Road onwards when coming from Canberra and at the property entry when approaching along Mountain Creek Road from the Yass/Wee Jasper end.</p>
