<h2>The story</h2>
<p>Bruce Neal was the son of Bob and Jan Neal who were very active endurance riders and members of ACTERA during the 1980s.</p>
<p>The Neals had an Arab stud near Canberra, <em>Wybalena Lodge</em>, that bred some successful endurance horses. The whole family, particularly Jan, were active and successful endurance riders.</p>
<p>Bruce rode as a junior but never got to realise his full potential for endurance riding. He died from cancer at an early age, leaving a wife and two small children.</p>
<p>Jan and Bob decided to fund the <em>Bruce Neal Trophy</em> in memory of their son, to recognise the horsemanship skills of young local riders.</p>

<h2>The trophy </h2>
<p>The Bruce Neal trophy is a perpetual trophy awarded each year to a worthy junior rider at the National Capital <em>Brookvale</em> ride. It is awarded on the basis of horsemanship demonstrated during the ride, as judged by the ride committee and head vet.</p>
<p>The trophy has been specially designed to incorporate a buckle of the kind used by ACTERA when Bruce was riding.</p>
